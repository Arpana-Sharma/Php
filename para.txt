one Girl is a 2014 American psychological thriller film directed by David Fincher and written by Gillian Flynn,
based on her 2012 novel of the same title. Set in Missouri, the story is a postmodern mystery[4][5] that 
follows the events surrounding Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), who becomes the prime suspect in the sudden
disappearance of his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike). The film also stars Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry.
The film had its world premiere on opening night of the 52nd New York Film Festival on September 26, 2014, 
before a nationwide theatrical release on October 3. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing 
$369 million on a budget of $61 million, becoming Fincher's highest-grossing film. The film is now considered 
a cult classic with some jokingly calling it a "romantic film".
Pike's performance was widely acclaimed by critics, and she received nominations for an Academy Award, BAFTA 
Award, Golden Globe Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress. Additional nominations included a 
Golden Globe Award for Best Director for Fincher and Golden Globe Award, BAFTA, and Critics' Choice Award 
nominations for Flynn's adapted screenplay, which won the Critics' Choice.[6]
